Your nodeJS packages as Native Desktop Apps.

# Introduction
Ooahh combines any nodejs code with pre built cross-platform binaries allowing instant deployment of HTML5 & Javascript based native applications on Windows, Mac, or Linux operating systems. With Ooahh any web developer can create desktop applications using
just HTML, CSS, & JS. Ooahh bridges the gap between programmers and web developers. With 2d, 3d, multimedia, & headless support your creativity is the limit.

# Installing

```bash
npm install -g ooahh
```

# Building
Step 1: Create an Ooahh app from scratch or using an example.
```hint
ooahh --init ./ooahh/
```

Step 2:Add your application code to the generated Ooahh source at:
```hint
./ooahh/
```
Step 3: Use Ooahh to generate binaries of your nodejs app
```hint

```

NOTE: You can port existing web sites & existing nodejs products into applications using Ooahh including those with either/both native & custom modules.

# PHILOSOPHY

The Ooahh philosophy is to provide a free open-source application framework using web technologies. The Ooahh goal is to allow anyone to use web technology to power their own native desktop applications that run and deploy cross-platform. With a permissive MIT license you may redeploy, resell, & redistribute applications built using Ooahh free of charge. This makes Ooahh a perfect candidate for anyone looking to create a desktop application using only web technologies.
