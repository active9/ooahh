##PHILOSOPHY

The Ooahh philosophy is to provide a free open-source application framework using web technologies. The Ooahh goal is to allow anyone to use free technology to power their own desktop applications that run and deploy cross-platform. With a permissive MIT license you may redeploy, resell, & redistribute applications built using Ooahh free of charge. This makes Ooahh a perfect candidate for anyone looking to create a desktop application using only web technologies.
